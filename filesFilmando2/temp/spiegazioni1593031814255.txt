I recommend you <b>Gladiator</b> for the contexts you have selected, because people who liked the movie think that <b>is ludicrous and reveals a profound ignorance of reality </b> and that <b>the music should have gotten the best supporting actor, because it completely captures the emotions of the characters, especially Maximus </b>. Moreover, they said that <b>it riles and stirs your emotion, and demands your attention </b>.</b>
I recommend you <b>Gladiator</b> because people who liked the movie think that it's perfect to watch in good mood because <b>the case is pretty sweet too</b>, and that it's perfect to spend an evening in sweet company because <b>the music is emotional and moving</b>; moreover, it's suitable for high attention contexts because <b>it's a wonderfully intriguing and complex story</b>.
